# 📚 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains solutions, notes, and implementations of important DSA concepts that I will practice regularly to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

---

## 🚀 Goals of this Repository
- Strengthen core DSA concepts  
- Improve logical and analytical thinking  
- Build consistent coding habits  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Maintain clean and optimized code
